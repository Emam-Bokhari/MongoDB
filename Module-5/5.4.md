### 1. `$in` Operator

**Command:** `{ field: { $in: [value1, value2, ...] } }`

**What it does:** Finds documents where the specified fieldâ€™s value matches any of the values in the given array.

**Example:** Find all female users with ages of 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30.


```js
db.test.find({ gender: "Female", age: { $in: [18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30] } });
```

**Output:**

```json
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Anna", "age": 18, "gender": "Female", "interests": ["Cooking", "Reading"] }
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Lily", "age": 22, "gender": "Female", "interests": ["Reading", "Traveling"] }
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Mia", "age": 30, "gender": "Female", "interests": ["Cooking", "Reading"] }
```

_This query finds all female users where their `age` is one of the values specified in the list._

### 2. Query with `$in` and Additional Condition

**Command:** `{ field: value, field: { $in: [value1, value2, ...] } }`

**What it does:** Finds documents where one field matches a specific value (e.g., `gender: "Female"`) and another field (`age`) is equal to any of the values in a specified list. This query uses implicit AND to require both conditions to be true.

**Example: **Find all female documents where `age` is one of the following: 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30.

```js
db.test.find({ gender: "Female", age: { $in: [18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30] } });
```

**Output:**

```json
{ "\_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Anna", "age": 18, "gender": "Female" }
{ "\_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Lily", "age": 22, "gender": "Female" }
{ "\_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Mia", "age": 26, "gender": "Female" }
```

_This query retrieves all female documents in the `test` collection where `age `matches any of the values specified in the list: 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30._

**In this query:**

- `gender: "Female"` specifies that only documents where `gender` is "Female" should be matched.

- `age: { $in: [18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30] }` limits the results to documents where the `age` is one of the values in the list.

- Both conditions must be true for a document to be returned, due to the **implicit AND** logic applied here.

### 3. Query with `$nin` (Not in Operator)

**Command:** `{ field: value, field: { $nin: [value1, value2, ...] } }`

**What it does:** Finds documents where a field's value is **not** in the specified list of values. The `$nin` operator is used to exclude documents with matching values in the list.

**Example:** Find all female documents where `age` is **not** one of the following: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16.

```js
db.test.find({
  gender: "Female",
  age: { $nin: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16] },
});
```

**Output:**

```json
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Anna", "age": 18, "gender": "Female" }
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Lily", "age": 22, "gender": "Female" }
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Mia", "age": 26, "gender": "Female" }
```

_This query retrieves all female documents in the `test` collection where the `age` is **not** one of the values in the list: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16._

**Explanation:**

- `gender: "Female"` filters the documents where gender is "Female".

- `age: { $nin: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16] }` excludes documents where the age is one of the values specified in the list. So, any document with an age that is part of the provided list will not be included in the result.

---

### 4. Query with `$nin` and an Additional Field Filter

**Command:** `{ field1: value1, field2: { $nin: [value1, value2, ...] }, field3: value2 }`

**What it does:** Finds documents that match **multiple conditions.** This query filters documents based on:

1. `gender` being "Female".

2. `age` **not** being one of the values in the list provided using the $nin operator.

3. `interests` containing "Cooking".

**Example:** Find all female documents where `age` is **not** one of the values: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16, and `interests `includes "Cooking".

```js
db.test.find({
  gender: "Female",
  age: { $nin: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16] },
  interests: "Cooking",
});
```

**Output:**

```json
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Anna", "age": 18, "gender": "Female", "interests": ["Cooking", "Reading"] }
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Lily", "age": 22, "gender": "Female", "interests": ["Cooking", "Traveling"] }
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Mia", "age": 26, "gender": "Female", "interests": ["Cooking", "Painting"] }
```

_This query retrieves all female documents where the `age` is **not** one of the values in the list, and the `interests` field contains "Cooking"._

**Explanation:**

- `gender: "Female"` filters the documents to include only females.

- `age: { $nin: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16] } `excludes documents where the age is any of the values specified in the list.

- `interests: "Cooking"` ensures that the document includes "Cooking" as one of the values in the `interests` field. If `interests` is an array, the query will check if "Cooking" exists in the array.

### 5. Query with `$nin` and `$in` Operators

**Command:** `{ field1: value1, field2: { $nin: [value1, value2, ...] }, field3: { $in: [value1, value2, ...] } }`

**What it does:** This query retrieves documents that match the following conditions:

1. `gender` must be "Female".

2. `age` must not be one of the values in the list using the `$nin` operator.

3. `interests` must contain one of the values in the provided list using the` $in` operator.

**Example:** Find all female documents where `age` is not one of the values in the list: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16, and where `interests` contains either "Cooking" or "Reading".

```js
db.test.find({
  gender: "Female",
  age: { $nin: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16] },
  interests: { $in: ["Cooking", "Reading"] },
});
```

**Output:**

```json
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Anna", "age": 18, "gender": "Female", "interests": ["Cooking", "Reading"] }
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Lily", "age": 22, "gender": "Female", "interests": ["Reading", "Traveling"] }
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Mia", "age": 26, "gender": "Female", "interests": ["Cooking", "Reading"] }
```

_This query retrieves all female documents where the `age` is **not** one of the values in the list, and the `interests` field contains **either **"Cooking" or "Reading"._

**Explanation:**

- `gender: "Female"` filters the documents to include only those where the gender is "Female".

- `age: { $nin: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16] }` excludes documents where `age` is any of the values in the provided array.

- `interests: { $in: ["Cooking", "Reading"] } `includes documents where the `interests` field contains **either** "Cooking" or "Reading". If the `interests` field is an array, the query checks if one of these values exists in the array.
