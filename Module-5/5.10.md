### 1. `$set` in MongoDB (Updating or Adding Fields in a Document)

**What it Does:**

The `$set` operator updates the value of a specified field in a document. If the field does not exist, it creates it. `$set` works with all types of fields, including strings, numbers, arrays, and nested objects.

**Use Cases:**

- Use `$set` to update an existing field's value or add a new field to a document.

- It is useful when you want to set a specific value in a document, regardless of the field's type or whether it already exists.

**Example:** Updating or Adding a Nested Field (`address.city`)
Suppose you want to update or add the `city` field under the `address` field in a document. Use the following command:

```js
db.test.updateOne(
  { _id: ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065") },
  { $set: { "address.city": "Dhaka" } }
);
```

**Explanation:**

- This command finds the document by `_id` and sets the `city` field under `address` to `"Dhaka"`.

- If `address.city` does not exist, MongoDB will add it.

**Output:**

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065"),
  "name": { "firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Emam Bokhari" },
  "address": { "city": "Dhaka" },
  "scores": [5, 8, 4],
  "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "French"],
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "Python"],
  "interests": ["Reading", "Traveling", "Taekwondo", "Judu", "Karate", "Car Driving", "Horse Riding"]
}
```

In this output, `address.city` is set to `"Dhaka"`, adding it if it wasnâ€™t already present.

### 2. `$set` in MongoDB (Updating Multiple Fields in a Document)

**What it Does:**

The `$set` operator in MongoDB updates or adds specified fields in a document. When used with multiple fields, it can update multiple values at once, creating new fields if they do not already exist in the document.

**Use Cases:**

- Use `$set` to **update multiple fields** in a single command.

- This is helpful when updating or adding fields with complex data, such as nested address details.

**Example:** Updating or Adding Multiple Address Fields (`address.city, address.street, address.country, address.village`)

Suppose you want to update or add multiple nested fields under `address` in a document. Use the following command:

```js
db.test.updateOne(
  { _id: ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065") },
  {
    $set: {
      "address.city": "Dhaka",
      "address.street": "Gulshan 02, Road No: 92/2",
      "address.country": "Bangladesh",
      "address.village": "Mojlishpur",
    },
  }
);
```

**Explanation:**

- This command locates the document by `_id` and sets the values of `city`, `street`, `country`, and `village` within the `address` field.

- If any of these fields (`city`, `street`, `country`, `village`) do not exist within `address`, MongoDB will add them.

**Output:**

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065"),
  "name": { "firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Emam Bokhari" },
  "address": {
    "city": "Dhaka",
    "street": "Gulshan 02, Road No: 92/2",
    "country": "Bangladesh",
    "village": "Mojlishpur"
  },
  "scores": [5, 8, 4],
  "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "French"],
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "Python"],
  "interests": ["Reading", "Traveling", "Taekwondo", "Judu", "Karate", "Car Driving", "Horse Riding"]
}
```

In this output, the `address `field has been updated with additional fields for `city`, `street`, `country`, and `village`, each with the specified values.

### 3. `$set` with Positional Operator (`$`) in MongoDB (Updating an Element in an Array of Subdocuments)

**What it Does:**

When using `$set` with the **positional operator**
in MongoDB, it allows updating a specific field within an array of subdocuments. The `$` operator targets the first array element that matches a specified condition.

**Use Cases:**

- Use `$set` with `$` to **update a field in an array of subdocuments** based on a condition.

- This is particularly useful when only one element in the array needs to be updated, and that element is identified by a unique value or criteria within the array.

**Example:** Updating the Major Field in an Education Array of Subdocuments

Suppose you have an `education` array within a document, and you want to update the `major` field of the subdocument where `degree` is `"Master of Science"`. Use the following command:

```js
db.test.updateOne(
{ \_id: ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065"), "education.degree": "Master of Science" },
{ $set: { "education.$.major": "CSE" } }
);

```

**Explanation:**

- This command locates the document by `\_id` and finds the first element in the `education` array where degree is `"Master of Science"`.

- The positional operator `$` matches this specific element, allowing the command to update its `major` field to `"CSE"`.

- If `major` does not exist in this subdocument, MongoDB will add it.

**Output (Example):**

```json
{
"\_id": ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065"),
"name": { "firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Emam Bokhari" },
"education": [
{ "degree": "Bachelor of Science", "major": "Physics" },
{ "degree": "Master of Science", "major": "CSE" }
],
...
}
```

In this output, the `major` field of the `Master of Science` subdocument in the `education` array has been updated to `"CSE"`.

### 4. `$inc` in MongoDB (Incrementing a Numeric Field)

**What it Does:**

The `$inc` operator in MongoDB increments (or decrements) the value of a numeric field by a specified amount. This operator can be used for **both positive and negative increments.**

**Use Cases:**

- Use `$inc` to **increase** a field's value by a certain amount.

- It can also **decrease** a value when used with a negative number.

- Commonly used to increment counters, update scores, adjust prices, or increment age values in user documents.

**Example:** Incrementing a User's Age by 1

Suppose you have a document with a field `age`, and you want to increase it by 1. The following command does this:

```js
db.test.updateOne(
{ \_id: ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000066") },
{ $inc: { age: 1 } }
);
```

**Explanation:**

- This command finds the document by `\_id` and increments the `age` field by `1`.

- If the `age` field does not exist in the document, MongoDB will create it and set it to the specified increment (e.g., `1`).

**Output (Example):**

If the original document was:

```json
{
"\_id": ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000066"),
"name": "John Doe",
"age": 29
}
```

After running the command, the document would be updated to:

```json
{
"\_id": ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000066"),
"name": "John Doe",
"age": 30
}
```
