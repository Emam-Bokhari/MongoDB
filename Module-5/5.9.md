### 1. `$unset` in MongoDB

**What it Does:**

The `$unset` operator is used to remove a specific field from a document.

- It takes the field name as the key and an empty string (`""`) as the value.
- The field will be completely removed from the document.

**Use Cases:**

- Use $unset when you want to delete an unnecessary or unwanted field from a document.
- It can be used for any field typeâ€”whether it's a string, number, array, or object.

**Example:** Removing the `age` field from a document.

```js
db.test.updateOne(
  { _id: ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065") },
  { $unset: { age: "" } }
);
```

**Explanation:**

This command will find the document by `_id` and remove the `age` field from it. After the operation, the `age` field will no longer be present in the document.

**Output:**

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065"),
  "name": { "firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Emam Bokhari" },
  "interests": ["Reading", "Traveling", "Taekwondo", "Judu", "Karate", "Car Driving", "Horse Riding"]
}
```

In this case, the `age` field is removed from the document.

### 2. $pop in MongoDB

**What it Does:**

The `$pop` operator removes the first or last element from an array in a document.

- To remove the **first element** in the array, use `$pop: -1`.

- To remove the **last element** in the array, use `$pop: 1`.

**Use Cases:**

- Use `$pop` when you want to manage array size by removing either the first or last element.

- Useful for implementing FIFO (First In, First Out) or LIFO (Last In, First Out) array behavior.

**Example:** Removing the first skill from a `skills` array.

```js
db.test.updateOne(
  { _id: ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065") },
  { $pop: { skills: -1 } }
);
```

**Explanation:**

This command finds the document by `_id` and removes the first element from the `skills` array. If the array has `[ "JavaScript", "Python", "SQL" ]`, the result would be `[ "Python", "SQL" ]`.

**Output:**

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065"),
  "name": { "firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Emam Bokhari" },
  "skills": ["Python", "SQL"],
  "interests": ["Reading", "Traveling", "Taekwondo", "Judu", "Karate", "Car Driving", "Horse Riding"]
}
```

In this example, the first skill (`"JavaScript"`) is removed from the `skills` array.

### 3. `$pop` in MongoDB (Removing the Last Element)

**What it Does:**

The `$pop` operator can also remove the **last element** of an array in a document.

- To remove the last element in the array, `use $pop: 1`.

**Use Cases:**

- Use `$pop` with `1 `when you want to implement a "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) removal in an array.

- Useful for managing arrays where you want to remove the most recent item or keep a fixed number of elements.

**Example:** Removing the last skill from a `skills` array.

```js
db.test.updateOne(
  { _id: ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065") },
  { $pop: { skills: 1 } }
);
```

**Explanation:**

This command finds the document by `_id` and removes the **last elemen**t from the `skills` array. For example, if the `skills` array initially has `[ "JavaScript", "Python", "SQL" ], the result will be [ "JavaScript", "Python" ]`.

**Output:**

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065"),
  "name": { "firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Emam Bokhari" },
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "Python"],
  "interests": ["Reading", "Traveling", "Taekwondo", "Judu", "Karate", "Car Driving", "Horse Riding"]
}
```

In this example, the last skill ("`SQL`") is removed from the `skills` array.

### 4. `$pull` in MongoDB (Removing Specific Elements from an Array)

**What it Does:**

The `$pull` operator removes **all instance**s of a specified value from an array within a document.

**Use Cases:**

- Use `$pull` when you want to **remove specific items** from an array based on a condition or exact value.

- Useful for removing unwanted values from an array, such as removing outdated or incorrect entries.

**Example:** Removing a Specific Language from the `languages` Array

Suppose you have a document where `languages` is an array of spoken languages. To remove `"Catalan"` from this array, use the following command:

```js
db.test.updateOne(
  { _id: ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065") },
  { $pull: { languages: "Catalan" } }
);
```

**Explanation:**

- This command finds the document with the specified `_id` and removes **all occurrences** of `"Catalan"` from the `languages` array.

- If the `languages` array initially contains `[ "English", "Spanish", "Catalan", "French" ]`, the result will be `[ "English", "Spanish", "French" ]`.

**Output:**

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065"),
  "name": { "firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Emam Bokhari" },
  "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "French"],
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "Python"],
  "interests": ["Reading", "Traveling", "Taekwondo", "Judu", "Karate", "Car Driving", "Horse Riding"]
}
```

In this output, `"Catalan"` was successfully removed from the `languages` array.

### 5. `$pull` in MongoDB (Removing Elements Based on Condition)

**What it Does:**

The `$pull `operator can also be used to remove elements from an array based on a specific condition rather than an exact value.

**Use Cases:**

- Use `$pull` with conditions to **remove items from an array that meet certain criteria**.

- Helpful for cleaning up arrays by removing items below or above a certain threshold, or based on specific conditions.

**Example:** Removing Scores Below 3 from the `scores` Array

Suppose you have a document with a `scores` array representing various scores a student has achieved. To remove all scores less than 3, use the following command:

```js
db.test.updateOne(
  { _id: ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065") },
  { $pull: { scores: { $lt: 3 } } }
);
```

**Explanation:**

- This command finds the document by \_id and removes all values in the scores array that are less than 3.

- If scores initially contains [5, 2, 8, 1, 4], this operation will result in [5, 8, 4].

**Output:**

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065"),
  "name": { "firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Emam Bokhari" },
  "scores": [5, 8, 4],
  "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "French"],
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "Python"],
  "interests": ["Reading", "Traveling", "Taekwondo", "Judu", "Karate", "Car Driving", "Horse Riding"]
}
```

In this output, scores below 3 (i.e., `2` and `1`) were successfully removed from the `scores` array.

### 6. `$pullAll` in MongoDB (Removing Multiple Specific Elements from an Array)

**What it Does:**
The `$pullAll` operator removes **all instances of specified values** from an array field in a document. Unlike` $pull`, which uses conditions, `$pullAll` requires you to specify exact values to remove.

**Use Cases:**

- Use `$pullAll` to **remove multiple specified elements from an array**.

- Ideal when you know the exact values to remove and want them all deleted, regardless of their position in the array.

**Example:** Removing Specific Scores (`9` and `7`) from the `scores` Array

Suppose you have a document with a `scores` array and want to remove all instances of `9` and `7`. Use the following command:

```js
db.test.updateOne(
{ \_id: ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065") },
{ $pullAll: { scores: [9, 7] } }
);
```

**Explanation:**

- This command finds the document by \`\_id`and removes all occurrences of the values`9`and`7`from the`scores` array.

- If `scores` initially contains `[9, 5, 7, 8, 9, 4]`, this operation will result in `[5, 8, 4]`.

**Output:**

```json
{
"\_id": ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000065"),
"name": { "firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Emam Bokhari" },
"scores": [5, 8, 4],
"languages": ["English", "Spanish", "French"],
"skills": ["JavaScript", "Python"],
"interests": ["Reading", "Traveling", "Taekwondo", "Judu", "Karate", "Car Driving", "Horse Riding"]
}
```

In this output, all instances of `9` and `7` have been removed from the `scores` array.
