### 1. MongoDB `$deleteOne` Operator

The `$deleteOne` operator in MongoDB removes a single document from a collection that matches the specified filter criteria. This is particularly useful when you need to delete a specific document by its unique identifier, `\_id`.

**Example:** Deleting a Document by `\_id`

To delete a single document with a specific `\_id`, you can use the following command:

```js
db.test.deleteOne({ \_id: ObjectId("6406ad63fc13ae5a40000066") });
```

**Explanation:**

- This command searches for a document in the `test` collection with the `\_id` of `6406ad63fc13ae5a40000066` and deletes it.

- If a matching document is found, it is permanently removed from the collection.

- If no document matches the filter, no changes are made.

**Example Output:** Assuming the document exists before running the command, the output will indicate success:

```
{ "acknowledged": true, "deletedCount": 1 }
```

If no document is found with the specified `\_id`, the output will be:

```
{ "acknowledged": true, "deletedCount": 0 }
```

**Summary**

- `$deleteOne` is used to delete a single document that matches the given filter.

- This operation only affects one document, even if multiple documents match the filter.

### 2. MongoDB `drop` Command with writeConcern

The `drop` command in MongoDB is used to permanently delete a collection, including all documents within it, indexes, and metadata. Adding a `writeConcern` option specifies the level of acknowledgment requested from MongoDB for this operation.

**Example:** Dropping a Collection with `writeConcern`

The following command deletes the `posts` collection with a write concern set to `w: 1`, which means MongoDB will acknowledge the operation as soon as the command is executed on the primary node.

```js
db.posts.drop({ writeConcern: { w: 1 } });
```

**Explanation:**

- `db.posts.drop():` This part drops the posts collection from the database.

- `{ writeConcern: { w: 1 } }:` This specifies the write concern level. Setting `w: 1` ensures that MongoDB acknowledges the drop operation once it is written to the primary node. Other values of w could be used to specify different levels of acknowledgment (e.g., `w: 0` for no acknowledgment or w: "majority" for acknowledgment from a majority of nodes in a replica set).

**Example Output:** If the collection is successfully dropped, the output will be:

```
true
```

If the collection does not exist, MongoDB will return `false` as the output:

```
false
```

**Summary**

- `drop` is used to remove an entire collection permanently.

- The `writeConcern` option in this command controls acknowledgment of the drop operation.
