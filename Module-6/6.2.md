### 1. Adding a `level` Field and Outputting Results to a New Collection

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  { $match: { gender: "Female" } },
  // stage-2
  { $addFields: { level: 2 } },
  // stage-3
  { $out: "course-students" },
]);
```

**Explanation:**

- Stage 1 (`$match`): Filters documents where `gender` is `"Female"`, so only those matching this condition will proceed to the next stages.

- Stage 2 (`$addFields`): Adds a new field, `level`, with a static value of `2` to each of the documents that passed the filter. This new field does not affect existing fields in the documents but is added to enrich the data.

- Stage 3 (`$out`): Outputs the modified documents to a new collection named `course-students`. If the collection course-students already exists, it will be overwritten. The `$out` stage is useful when you want to store the results of an aggregation pipeline in a persistent way, creating a new collection for analysis or reporting.

**Example Output** in `course-students` Collection:

```js
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Alice", "gender": "Female", "level": 2 }
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Sophia", "gender": "Female", "level": 2 }
```

**In the output:**

- Only documents with `gender` as `"Female"` are included.

- Each document now has a `level` field with a value of `2`.

- All results are stored in the `course-students` collection.

### 2. Adding a Field and Merging Results with the Original Collection

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  { $addFields: { level: 2 } },
  // stage-2
  { $merge: "test" },
]);
```

**Explanation:**

- **Stage 1** (`$addFields`): Adds a new field `level` with a static value of `2` to each document in the `test` collection. This stage allows you to modify the documents by adding extra information without altering existing fields.

- **Stage 2** (`$merge`): Merges the modified documents back into the `test` collection. The `$merge` stage is used to write the aggregation output to a collection, either by updating existing documents, inserting new ones, or replacing the whole document. By default, `$merge` uses the `_id` field to match documents in the target collection (`test`), so it updates documents with the same `_id`. If a document does not exist in the collection, `$merge` will insert it.

**Example Result:**

```js
{ "\_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Alice", "gender": "Female", "level": 2 }
{ "\_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Bob", "gender": "Male", "level": 2 }
```

**In the output:**

- Every document in the `test` collection now includes a `level` field with the value `2`.

- The `test` collection is updated directly, so no new collection is created.
