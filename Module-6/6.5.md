### 1. Unwinding the `friends` Array and Counting Occurrences of Each Friend

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  { $unwind: "$friends" },
  // stage-2
  { $group: { _id: "$friends", total: { $sum: 1 } } },
]);
```

**Stage 1: Unwinding**

- `$unwind: "$friends"`: This stage deconstructs the `friends` array field in each document, creating a separate document for each element in the array. For example, if a document has multiple friends, each friend will become its own document.

**Stage 2: Grouping and Counting**

- `$group: { _id: "$friends", total: { $sum: 1 } }`: This stage groups the documents by each unique friend. By using `$sum: 1`, it counts how many times each friend appears across all documents.

**What Happens:**

- The pipeline first unwinds the `friends` array so that each friend appears as an individual document.

- Then, it groups these documents by each friend and counts the total occurrences of each one across all documents.

**Example Output:**
Assuming a document structure like this:

```js
{ "_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "friends": ["Bob", "Charlie"] }
{ "_id": 2, "name": "David", "friends": ["Alice", "Charlie"] }
{ "_id": 3, "name": "Eve", "friends": ["Bob", "Alice"] }
```

The output might look like this:

```js
{ "_id": "Bob", "total": 2 }
{ "_id": "Charlie", "total": 2 }
{ "_id": "Alice", "total": 2 }
```

**In the Output:**

Each friend is represented in the `_id` field, along with a `total` field that shows the count of occurrences across all documents.

### 2. Unwinding the interests Array and Grouping by Age

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  { $unwind: "$interests" },
  // stage-2
  { $group: { _id: "$age", interestsByAge: { $push: "$interests" } } },
]);
```

**Stage 1: Unwinding**

- `$unwind: "$interests"`: This stage breaks down the `interests` array in each document, creating separate documents for each interest. If a document has multiple interests, each interest will be a distinct document, keeping other fields (like `age`) the same across the new documents.

**Stage 2: Grouping by Age**

- `$group: { _id: "$age", interestsByAge: { $push: "$interests" } }`: This stage groups documents by the `age` field. For each age, it collects all the interests into an array called `interestsByAge` using `$push`.

**What Happens:**

- The pipeline first separates each element in the `interests` array into individual documents.

- Then, it groups these documents by age and gathers all interests for each age group into a single array.

**Example Output:**
Assuming a collection with documents like:

```js
{ "\_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "age": 25, "interests": ["Reading", "Traveling"] }
{ "\_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "age": 25, "interests": ["Cooking"] }
{ "\_id": 3, "name": "Charlie", "age": 30, "interests": ["Music", "Sports"] }
```

The output might look like this:

```js
{ "\_id": 25, "interestsByAge": ["Reading", "Traveling", "Cooking"] }
{ "\_id": 30, "interestsByAge": ["Music", "Sports"] }
```

**In the Output:**

Each document represents a unique age (`_id` field), and `interestsByAge` is an array of all interests associated with people of that age.
