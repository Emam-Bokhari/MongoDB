### 1. MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Operators Used

- $lookup

This MongoDB aggregation pipeline uses the `$lookup` stage to perform a left outer join between two collections, `orders` and `test`, based on a matching field.

**Explanation of Each Part**

1. **Collection Names**

- Primary Collection: `orders` (where the aggregation is run).

- Joined Collection: `test` (contains user information).

2. **Stage 1**: `$lookup`

- Purpose: To combine data from the `orders` collection with related data from the `test` collection based on a common field.

- **Fields and Parameters:**

  - `from`: Specifies the collection to join with, in this case, `"test"`.

  - `localField`: The field in the `orders` collection that references a value in the test collection. Here, it’s `"userId"`.

  - `foreignField`: The field in the `test` collection that matches `localField` in `orders`. Here, it’s `"_id"`.

  - `as`: Defines the name of the new array field in `orders` where the matching documents from `test` will be stored. Here, it’s `"user"`.

**What Happens**

- For each document in `orders`, the pipeline looks for documents in `test` where the `_id` matches the `userId` in `orders`.

- If a match is found, the corresponding document(s) from `test` are added as an array in the `user` field of the `orders` document.

- If no match is found, `user` will be an empty array for that `orders` document.

**Example**

Assuming you have documents in `orders` and `test` like the following:

**`orders` Collection**

```js
{ "_id": 1, "userId": 101, "product": "Laptop", "quantity": 2 }
{ "_id": 2, "userId": 102, "product": "Phone", "quantity": 1 }
```

**`test` Collection**

```js
{ "_id": 101, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" }
{ "_id": 102, "name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com" }
```

**Output**

The output after running this aggregation pipeline might look like:

```js
{
"_id": 1,
"userId": 101,
"product": "Laptop",
"quantity": 2,
"user": [
{ "_id": 101, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" }
]
}
{
"_id": 2,
"userId": 102,
"product": "Phone",
"quantity": 1,
"user": [
{ "_id": 102, "name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com" }
]
}
```

In each `orders` document, a `user` field is added containing the corresponding `test` document with matching `userId`. This provides complete information about the user for each order.
