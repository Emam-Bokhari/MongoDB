### 1. `Aggregate` Syntex

```js
db.collection.aggregate(
[
    //state 1
    {}, --> pipeline
    //state 2
    {}, --> pipeline
    //state 3
    {}, --> pipeline
]
)
```

### 2. Using `$match` to Filter Documents by Age

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([{ $match: { age: 24 } }]);
```

**Explanation:** This query uses the `$match` stage within the aggregation framework to filter documents where the `age` field has a value of `24`. It will pass only those documents with `age: 24` to the next stage in the pipeline, if any. This is equivalent to filtering for `age: 24` using a `find` query but allows further stages to be added for more complex processing.

**Example Output:**

```js
{ "\_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Ahmad", "age": 24, "occupation": "Research Associate" }
{ "\_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Sara", "age": 24, "occupation": "Data Analyst" }
```

**In the output:**

- Ahmad's document has an `age` field with a value of 24, so it is included.

- Sara's document also has an `age` of 24, so it is included.

Any documents where `age` does not equal 24 will be excluded.

### 3. Using `$match` to Filter by Multiple Conditions

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { gender: "Male", age: { $lt: 30 } },
  },
]);
```

**Explanation:** This query uses the `$match` stage within the aggregation framework to filter documents in the `test` collection. It selects documents where:

- The `gender` field is `"Male"`.

- The `age` field is less than 30, specified by the `$lt` (less than) operator.

This means only documents that meet **both** conditions `(gender: "Male" and age < 30)` will be included in the results. This query is useful when you want to narrow down a dataset based on multiple criteria before processing it further in the aggregation pipeline.

**Example Output:**

```js
{ "\_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "John", "gender": "Male", "age": 28 }
{ "\_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Mike", "gender": "Male", "age": 25 }
```

**In the output:**

- John’s document has `gender` set to `"Male"` and `age` to 28, so it is included.

- Mike’s document also has `gender: "Male"` and `age: 25`, so it is included.

Documents where `gender` is not `"Male"` or where `age` is 30 or above will be excluded from the result.

### 4. Using `$match` and `$project` Stages to Filter by Conditions and Select Specific Fields

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  { $match: { gender: "Male", age: { $lt: 30 } } },
  // stage-2
  { $project: { name: 1, gender: 1, age: 1 } },
]);
```

**Explanation:**

1. Stage 1 ($match): The first stage filters documents in the test collection to include only those where:

- `gender` is `"Male"`.

- `age` is less than 30 (using the `$lt` operator).

This narrows down the dataset to include only documents that match both conditions.

2. Stage 2 (`$project`): The second stage specifies which fields should be included in the output. Here:

- `name`, `gender`, and `age` fields are included by setting them to `1`.

- Any fields not specified in `$project` (like `address`, `email`, `occupation`) are excluded from the output.

This pipeline is helpful for filtering down to relevant documents and returning only necessary fields, which can make the data easier to read and optimize performance when working with large collections.

**Example Output:**

```js
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "John Doe", "gender": "Male", "age": 28 }
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Mike", "gender": "Male", "age": 25 }
```

**In the output:**

- Only documents where `gender` is `"Male"` and `age` is less than 30 are included.

- Each document shows only the `name`, `gender`, and `age` fields, while other fields in the original documents are excluded.

This selective projection improves efficiency by limiting data to only the most relevant fields and documents.
