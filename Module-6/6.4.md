### 1. Summing Total Salary, Counting Total Staff, and Calculating Salary Statistics

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      totalSalary: { $sum: "$salary" },
      totalStaff: { $sum: 1 },
      highestSalary: { $max: "$salary" },
      lowestSalary: { $min: "$salary" },
      averageSalary: { $avg: "$salary" },
    },
  },
]);
```

**Stage 1: Grouping**

- `$group`: Aggregates all documents to calculate salary statistics and count total staff members:

  - `totalSalary: { $sum: "$salary" }`: Sums up the `salary` values across all documents and stores it in the `totalSalary` field.

  - `totalStaff: { $sum: 1 }`: Counts the number of documents (staff members) in the collection by summing `1` for each document, storing the count in `totalStaff`.

  - `highestSalary: { $max: "$salary" }`: Finds the highest `salary` value.

  -` lowestSalary: { $min: "$salary" }`: Finds the lowest `salary` value.

  - `averageSalary: { $avg: "$salary" }`: Computes the average salary value across all documents.

  - `_id: null`: Groups all documents into a single result, as `_id: null` means no separate grouping by field values.

**What Happens:**

This pipeline calculates and returns the total salary, total number of staff, highest salary, lowest salary, and average salary.

**Example Output:**

```js
{
"\_id": null,
"totalSalary": 450000,
"totalStaff": 10,
"highestSalary": 85000,
"lowestSalary": 30000,
"averageSalary": 50000
}
```

**In the Output:**

- `totalSalary`: The sum of all salary values.
- `totalStaff`: Total count of documents/staff members.
- `highestSalary`: The maximum salary found.
- `lowestSalary`: The minimum salary found.
- `averageSalary`: The average salary.

### 2. Calculating Salary Statistics and Salary Range

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      totalSalary: { $sum: "$salary" },
      totalStaff: { $sum: 1 },
      highestSalary: { $max: "$salary" },
      lowestSalary: { $min: "$salary" },
      averageSalary: { $avg: "$salary" },
    },
  },

  // stage-2
  {
    $project: {
      totalStaff: 1,
      highestSalary: 1,
      lowestSalary: 1,
      avgSalary: "$averageSalary",
      range: { $subtract: ["$highestSalary", "$lowestSalary"] },
    },
  },
]);
```

**Stage 1: Grouping**

- `$group`: Aggregates all documents to calculate total salary, total staff count, highest and lowest salary, and average salary:

  - `totalSalary: { $sum: "$salary" }`: Sums up the `salary` values across all documents.

  - `totalStaff: { $sum: 1 }`: Counts the number of documents (staff members).

  - `highestSalary: { $max: "$salary" }`: Finds the highest salary.

  - `lowestSalary: { $min: "$salary" }`: Finds the lowest salary.

  - `averageSalary: { $avg: "$salary" }`: Computes the average salary.

  - `_id: null`: Treats the entire collection as a single group.

**Stage 2: Projecting**

- `$project`: Specifies the fields to keep and includes a new calculated field for the salary range:

  - `totalStaff: 1`: Keeps the `totalStaff` field in the output.

  - `highestSalary`: 1: Keeps the `highestSalary` field in the output.

  - `lowestSalary`: 1: Keeps the `lowestSalary` field in the output.

  - `avgSalary: "$averageSalary"`: Renames `averageSalary` to `avgSalary`.

  - `range: { $subtract: ["$highestSalary", "$lowestSalary"] }`: Calculates the salary range by subtracting the lowest salary from the highest.

**What Happens:**

This pipeline calculates various salary statistics and adds a new field, range, representing the difference between the highest and lowest salaries.

**Example Output:**

```js
{
"\_id": null,
"totalStaff": 10,
"highestSalary": 85000,
"lowestSalary": 30000,
"avgSalary": 50000,
"range": 55000
}
```

**In the Output:**

- `totalStaff`: The count of staff members.

- `highestSalary`: The maximum salary found.

- `lowestSalary`: The minimum salary found.

- `avgSalary`: The average salary (renamed from `averageSalary`).

- `range`: The difference between the highest and lowest salary, giving insight into the salary range within the collection.
