### 1. MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Operators Used

- $facet

This MongoDB aggregation pipeline uses the `$facet` stage to run multiple pipelines simultaneously on the same dataset. Each pipeline performs specific operations, allowing you to obtain separate counts for `friends`, `interests`, and `skills`. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each pipeline:

**Pipelines and Stages Explained**

1.  **Pipeline 1**: `friendsCount`

    - **Purpose:** Counts the number of `friends` for each document.

        - **Stages:**
            - **Stage 1** (`$unwind`): Deconstructs the `friends` array, creating a separate document for each friend.

            - **Stage 2** (`$group`): Groups by `"friends"` and calculates the total count using `{ $sum: 1 }`.

2. **Pipeline 2:** `interestsCount`

    - **Purpose:** Counts the occurrences of each `interest`.
    - **Stages:**
        - **Stage 1** (`$unwind`): Deconstructs the `interests` array, creating a separate document for each interest.

        - **Stage 2** (`$group`): Groups by `"interests"` and calculates the total count using `{ $sum: 1 }`.

3. **Pipeline 3:** `skillsInfo`

    - **Purpose:** Counts the occurrences of each `skill`.

    - **Stages:**

        - **Stage 1** (`$unwind`): Deconstructs the `skills` array, creating a separate document for each skill.

        - **Stage 2** (`$group`): Groups by `"$skills"` and calculates the total count using `{ $sum: 1 }`.

**Explanation of `$facet`**

The `$facet` stage allows these three pipelines `(friendsCount, interestsCount, and skillsInfo)` to run independently within the same aggregation pipeline, each generating a different subset of results.

**Example Output:**

The output of this query would be an object with fields friendsCount, interestsCount, and skillsInfo, each containing an array of grouped counts. For example:


```js
{
    "friendsCount": [
        { "_id": "John", "total": 5 },
        { "_id": "Jane", "total": 3 }
// other friends with their counts
],
    "interestsCount": [
        { "_id": "Reading", "total": 4 },
        { "_id": "Traveling", "total": 7 }
// other interests with their counts
],
    "skillsInfo": [
        { "_id": "JavaScript", "total": 6 },
        { "_id": "Python", "total": 5 }
// other skills with their counts
    ]
}
```

Each facet provides a breakdown of counts based on the fields of interest (`friends`, `interests`, and `skills`).
