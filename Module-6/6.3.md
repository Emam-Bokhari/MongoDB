### 1. Grouping by Gender

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  { $group: { _id: "$gender" } },
]);
```

**Explanation:**

- Stage 1 (`$group`): Groups the documents in the `test` collection by the `gender` field. The `$group` stage is used to aggregate data based on specific criteria. Here, the `_id` is set to `"$gender"`, which means that each unique value in the `gender` field will create a separate group in the result.

- Since thereâ€™s no additional aggregation specified (like `$sum`, `$avg`, etc.), it simply returns each unique value of the `gender` field without any further calculations or fields.

**Example Result:**

```js
{ "_id": "Male" }
{ "_id": "Female" }
```

**In the output:**

- Each document in the result represents a unique gender from the `test` collection, grouping all documents with that gender.

### 2. Grouping by Gender and Counting Total Documents in Each Group

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  { $group: { _id: "$gender", total: { $sum: 1 } } },
]);
```

**Explanation:**

1. Stage 1 (`$group`): Groups the documents in the `test` collection by the `gender` field and calculates the total number of documents in each group.

- The `_id` field is set to `"$gender"`, which groups documents by each unique value of the `gender` field.

- The `total` field is created, where `$sum: 1` increments by 1 for each document in the group, giving the total count of documents per gender.

**Example Result:**

```js
{ "_id": "Male", "total": 45 }
{ "_id": "Female", "total": 55 }
```

**In the output:**

Each document represents a gender group (`"Male"` or `"Female"`) with the `total` field showing the count of documents in that group.

### 3. Grouping by Country and Pushing Names of Users from Each Country

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  { $group: { _id: "$address.country", name: { $push: "$name" } } },
]);
```

**Explanation:**

1. Stage 1 (`$group`):

- Groups documents based on the `address.country` field.

- Creates a new array `name`, which uses the `$push` operator to collect the `name` field from all documents within the same country group.

**What Happens:**

- For each unique country in the `address.country` field, this aggregation will create a group, and in each group, it will gather an array of `name` values (i.e., the names of users who belong to that country).

**Example Result:**

```js
{ "_id": "Somalia", "name": ["Alice", "Bob"] }
{ "_id": "USA", "name": ["Charlie", "David"] }
```

**In the Output:**

- The `_id` field represents the country (ex: "`Somalia`" or "`USA`").

- The `name` field is an array containing the names of users from that particular country.

### 4. Grouping by Country, Counting Users, and Pushing Names

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$address.country",
      total: { $sum: 1 },
      name: { $push: "$name" },
    },
  },
]);
```

**Explanation:**

1. Stage 1 (`$group`):

- `_id: "$address.country"`: Groups the documents by the `address.country` field. Each group will represent a unique country.

- `total: { $sum: 1 }`: Counts the number of documents (users) in each group (country) and stores this count in a field called `total`.

- `name: { $push: "$name" }`: Collects the `name` field of each document in the group into an array. The array will contain the names of all users from that specific country.

**What Happens:**

- For each unique address.country, it will calculate: 1. The total number of users from that country (`total`). 2. An array of user names (`name`) for that country.

**Example Output:**

```js
{ "\_id": "Somalia", "total": 3, "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"] }
{ "\_id": "USA", "total": 2, "name": ["David", "Eve"] }
```

**In the Output:**

- The `_id` field represents the country (e.g., "`Somalia`", "`USA`").
- The `total` field contains the number of users in that country.
- The `name` field is an array of names of users from that country.

### 5. Grouping by Country, Counting Users, and Pushing Entire Documents

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$address.country",
      total: { $sum: 1 },
      name: { $push: "$$ROOT" },
    },
  },
]);
```

**Explanation:**

1. Stage 1 (`$group`):

   - `_id: "$address.country"`: Groups the documents by the `address.country` field. This means that each unique country will form a separate group.

   - `total: { $sum: 1 }`: Counts the number of documents (users) in each group and stores this count in a field called `total`.

   - `name: { $push: "$$ROOT" }`: The `$$ROOT` operator refers to the entire document. This will push the entire document of each user into the `name` array. As a result, the output for each country will include an array of all the user documents from that country.

**What Happens:**

- For each unique `address.country`, it will calculate:

  1. The total number of users from that country (`total`).

  2. An array of entire user documents (`name`) for that country.

**Example Output:**

```js
{
"\_id": "Somalia",
"total": 3,
"name": [
{ "_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "address": { "country": "Somalia" }, "age": 30 },
{ "_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "address": { "country": "Somalia" }, "age": 28 },
{ "_id": 3, "name": "Charlie", "address": { "country": "Somalia" }, "age": 25 }
]
}
{
"\_id": "USA",
"total": 2,
"name": [
{ "_id": 4, "name": "David", "address": { "country": "USA" }, "age": 35 },
{ "_id": 5, "name": "Eve", "address": { "country": "USA" }, "age": 40 }
]
}
```

**In the Output:**

- The `_id` field represents the country (e.g., `"Somalia"`, `"USA"`).

- The `total` field contains the number of users in that country.

- The `name` field contains an array of complete user documents from that country.

### 6. Grouping by Country, Counting Users, and Pushing Entire Documents

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$address.country",
      total: { $sum: 1 },
      fullDocuments: { $push: "$$ROOT" },
    },
  },
  // stage-2
  {
    $project: {
      "fullDocuments.name": 1,
      "fullDocuments.email": 1,
      "fullDocuments.age": 1,
      "fullDocuments.address.country": 1,
    },
  },
]);
```

**Stage 1: Grouping**

- `$group`: This stage groups the documents by `address.country`.

  - `_id: "$address.country"`: Groups the documents by `address.country`.

  - `total: { $sum: 1 }`: Adds a count (`total`) of documents in each group (i.e., number of users per country).

  - `fullDocuments: { $push: "$$ROOT" }`: Pushes the entire document of each user (i.e., all fields of the document) into an array called `fullDocuments`.

- Stage 2: Projecting Specific Fields

  - `$project`: This stage reshapes the documents, including only the fields specified for `fullDocuments`.

  - It includes `name`, `email`, `age`, and `address.country` for each document in the `fullDocuments` array.

  - `"fullDocuments.name"`: 1: Includes the `name` field.

  - `"fullDocuments.email"`: 1: Includes the `email` field.

  - `"fullDocuments.age"`: 1: Includes the `age` field.

  - `"fullDocuments.address.country"`: 1: Includes the `address.country` field.

**What Happens:**

- For each unique `address.country`, the aggregation pipeline will:

  1. Count the total number of users from that country (`total`).

  1. Push the entire document of each user into `fullDocuments`.

  1. Project only the selected fields (`name`, `email`, `age`, and `address.country`) for each document in the `fullDocuments` array.

**Example Output:**

```js
{
"\_id": "Somalia",
"total": 3,
"fullDocuments": [
{ "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "age": 30, "address": { "country": "Somalia" } },
{ "name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com", "age": 28, "address": { "country": "Somalia" } },
{ "name": "Charlie", "email": "charlie@example.com", "age": 25, "address": { "country": "Somalia" } }
]
}
{
"\_id": "USA",
"total": 2,
"fullDocuments": [
{ "name": "David", "email": "david@example.com", "age": 35, "address": { "country": "USA" } },
{ "name": "Eve", "email": "eve@example.com", "age": 40, "address": { "country": "USA" } }
]
}
```

**In the Output:**

- The `_id` field represents the country (e.g., `"Somalia"`, `"USA"`).

- The `total` field contains the count of users from each country.

- The `fullDocuments` array contains user details, including only the fields `name`, `email`, `age`, and `address.country` for each user.
