### 1. Bucket-Based Age Grouping with `$bucket`

**Command:**

```js
db.test.aggregate([
  // stage-1
  {
    $bucket: {
      groupBy: "$age", // Field to group by
      boundaries: [0, 20, 40, 60, 80], // Defines the age ranges
      default: "over79", // Category for ages above the highest boundary
      output: {
        total: { $sum: 1 }, // Count of documents in each bucket
        age: { $push: "$age" }, // Collects ages in each bucket
      },
    },
  },
]);
```

**Stage 1: Bucketing by Age**

- `$bucket`: This stage divides documents into specified age ranges (or buckets) based on the age field.

- `groupBy: "$age"`: The field that determines the bucket each document goes into, here it's age.

- `boundaries: [0, 20, 40, 60, 80]`: The age boundaries for each bucket. Each bucket will cover ages from the start of one boundary up to (but not including) the next. So, `[0, 20]` includes ages 0 through 19, `[20, 40]` covers 20 through 39, and so on.

- `default: "over79"`: If a document’s age exceeds 79, it will fall into a default bucket labeled "over79".

- `output`: Specifies the output fields for each bucket.

      - `total: { $sum: 1 }`: Counts the number of documents in each bucket.

      - `age: { $push: "$age" }`: Collects the `age` values of documents in each bucket as an array.

**What Happens:**

- The pipeline organizes documents into age groups (0–19, 20–39, 40–59, 60–79, and over 79).

- For each age group, it counts how many documents are in that range (`total`) and collects the ages of those documents into an array (`age`).

**Example Output:**
Assuming a collection with documents like:

```js
{ "\_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "age": 23 }
{ "\_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "age": 35 }
{ "\_id": 3, "name": "Charlie", "age": 45 }
{ "\_id": 4, "name": "David", "age": 63 }
{ "\_id": 5, "name": "Eva", "age": 82 }
```

The output might look like this:

```js
{ "\_id": 0, "total": 1, "age": [23] }
{ "\_id": 20, "total": 1, "age": [35] }
{ "\_id": 40, "total": 1, "age": [45] }
{ "\_id": 60, "total": 1, "age": [63] }
{ "\_id": "over79", "total": 1, "age": [82] }
```

**In the Output:**

- Each document represents an age bucket, with `_id` indicating the boundary (e.g., 0, 20, 40) or `"over79"` for ages over 79.

- `total` shows the number of people in that age range.

- `age` lists the ages of individuals in that bucket.

### 2. MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Operators Used

- `$bucket`
- `$sort`
- `$limit`
- `$project`

This pipeline performs several stages to group documents by age range, sort the groups by total count in descending order, limit the results to the top 3 groups, and finally project only the total field.

**Stages in Detail:**
**Stage 1: Bucket-Based Age Grouping with `$bucket`**

**Command:**

```js
{
    $bucket: {
        groupBy: "$age", // Field to group by
        boundaries: [0, 20, 40, 60, 80], // Defines the age ranges
        default: "over79", // Bucket for ages above 79
        output: {
            total: { $sum: 1 }, // Counts documents in each bucket
            age: { $push: "$age" } // Collects ages into an array for each bucket
        }
    }
}
```

- `$bucket` groups documents based on specified `age` boundaries.

**Output fields:**

- `total:` Total documents in each bucket.
- `age:` List of `age` values within each bucket.

**Stage 2: Sorting with `$sort`**

```js
{
  $sort: {
    total: -1;
  }
}
```

Sorts the buckets by `total` in descending order, so buckets with the highest document counts appear first.

**Stage 3: Limiting Results with `$limit`**

```js
{
  $limit: 3;
}
```

**Limits** the output to the top 3 buckets based on total count after sorting.

**Stage 4: Projecting Fields with `$project`**

```js
{
  $project: {
    total: 1;
  }
}
```

Projects only the `total` field in the final output, hiding other fields like `_id` and `age` in each bucket.

**Example Output:**
Assuming a collection like:

```js
{ "\_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "age": 23 }
{ "\_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "age": 35 }
{ "\_id": 3, "name": "Charlie", "age": 45 }
{ "\_id": 4, "name": "David", "age": 63 }
{ "\_id": 5, "name": "Eva", "age": 82 }
{ "\_id": 6, "name": "Frank", "age": 25 }
```

The output might look like this:

```js
{ "\_id": 20, "total": 2 } // Ages 20–39
{ "\_id": 40, "total": 1 } // Ages 40–59
{ "\_id": 60, "total": 1 } // Ages 60–79
```

**In the Output:**

Only the `total` field is included for each of the top 3 age buckets, showing the count of documents in each.
